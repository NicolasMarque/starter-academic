In this paper we prove some rigidity theorems associated to Q-curvature analysis on asymptotically Euclidean (AE) manifolds, which are inspired by the analysis of conservation principles
within fourth order gravitational theories. A central object in this analysis is a notion of fourth
order energy, previously analysed by the authors, which is subject to a positive energy theorem.
We show that this energy can be more geometrically rewritten in terms of a fourth order analogue
to the Ricci tensor, which we denote by Jg. This allows us to prove that Yamabe positive J-flat
AE manifolds must be isometric to Euclidean space. As a by product, we prove that this J-tensor
provides a geometric control for the optimal decay rates at infinity. This last result reinforces the
analogy of J as a fourth order analogue to the Ricci tensor.
